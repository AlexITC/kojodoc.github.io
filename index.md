## Getting Started

To get going with Kojo, use the [Getting Started](http://wiki.kogics.net/kojo-codeactive-books#getting-started) book.
This book will help you learn:
* the basic turtle graphics commands available in Kojo.
* how to write programs using these commands - to draw on the canvas.
* how to make geometric patterns.
* how to analyze given geometric patterns, and to recreate these patterns in a structured way - via programs that you write.

## Turtle graphics reference
As you go through the Getting Started book, it's useful to be able to see all the [basic turtle commands](reference/turtle.html) in one place.

## Core concepts
It's also useful to be able to see all the [core concepts](concepts/core-ideas.html) in one place.

## Art Ideas
To spice things up as you go along, [here are a bunch of art ideas](art-ideas/shape-block.html).

## Colors
What's art without colors? Kojo has great support for colors, and it's good for you [to know the details](concepts/colors.html).
