## Why learn to program?

Here's a brief answer:

* To better understand the world around us.
  * By providing a deeper knowledge of computation - the foundation of the digital world that’s augmenting the physical world. Here are some examples related to computation and its effect on the world:
    * How is computation delivered to the world?
      * Via (web)apps – google search, google maps, amazon/flipkart, ola/uber, netflix, banking.
    * Smart cities - a computation rich scenario:
      * IoT, AI, Systems
      * Transportation (e.g. smart traffic lights)
      * Health (linked body sensors ↔ transportation ↔ hospitals)
      * Energy (smart buildings, smart road lighting)
      * Security (cameras, sensors, social feeds)
* Brain exercise (with reinforcement).
  * Creative, logical, and critical thinking.
* To have a new way to learn art, music, science, and mathematics.
  * For deeper understanding and exploring synergies.
* As a medium to understand processes and learn problem solving.
* To provide practice with the process of creation, analysis, and design.
* As a medium for communication and collaboration.
* To build up a scalable world changing skill.
  * Inventor mindset.
  * Or get a job and earn a decent (or great) living.


## Why Kojo
Kojo is a modern programming environment with a powerful programming language ([Scala](http://scala-lang.org)).

The motto in Kojo is – *Play*. *Create*. *Learn*.

In Kojo, children play with small Scala programs. They create drawings, animations, games, and Arduino based intelligent circuits (with appropriate additional hardware). And they learn logical and creative thinking, programming, problem solving, math, physics, emotional grit, collaboration (via pair programming), and a lot more.

Take a look at the Kojo Showcase (from the *Showcase* menu inside Kojo) to get a feel for what is possible with Kojo.

One of the major foundational goals of the Kojo project is for kids to learn how to *learn with understanding* – given the opportunity to apply learned ideas to many different situations, and the exploration, discovery, and creation involved in this process. All of this fosters in them a mindset of experimentation, innovation, self-reliance, growth, mental discipline, and teamwork – with Kojo as the enabler.
      

All of this relates well to the goals of education that were enunciated very nicely by Shri Auribindo:  
*Learn to know*, *Learn to do*, *Learn to be*, *Learn to live together*. More on that some other day.
