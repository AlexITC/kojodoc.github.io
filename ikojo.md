## iKojo

Welcome to the [iKojo](http://ikojo.kogics.net) page. iKojo is the web based version of Kojo. 

iKojo supports the following subset of the features of desktop Kojo:
* Most of turtle graphics (for an easy beginning).
* Most of Picture graphics for gaming (for easy sharing of games developed within desktop Kojo).

Here are some examples showing the above features in action:

Drawings:
* [A square](http://ikojo.kogics.net/sf/g1fJBcD/0)
* [A colored pattern with pentagons](http://ikojo.kogics.net/sf/oR9PJ43/0)
* [A flower](http://ikojo.kogics.net/sf/AlUnOa0/0)
* [A tree](http://ikojo.kogics.net/sf/NrOU9qJ/0)

Games:
* [Pong](http://ikojo.kogics.net/sf/nOB7vtO/0)
* [Hunted](http://ikojo.kogics.net/sf/KQPttLI/0)
* [Bugs](http://ikojo.kogics.net/sf/OuGi82j/0)
* [Car Ride](http://ikojo.kogics.net/sf/erwlDLW/0)
* [Lunar Lander](http://ikojo.kogics.net/sf/Y3MnOHR/0)

### Background information
The core idea behind iKojo is the following:
* To enable users to easily start experimenting with Kojo without having to download/install anything. When they want to dig deeper and do more serious programming, they can download/install the Kojo desktop app.
* To enable users to easily share (via a web link) the games and simulations that they write in Kojo. The game or simulation can be developed in desktop Kojo, and then shared via iKojo.  
Note - generative art that is created within desktop Kojo can easily be shared as an image via the many image sharing apps that exist out there.
