**i**Kojo is the **i**nternet/web based version of Kojo. It supports the following subset of the features of desktop Kojo:
* Most of [turtle graphics](reference/turtle.html) (for an easy beginning).
* Most of [Picture graphics for gaming](reference/gaming.html) (for easy sharing of games developed within desktop Kojo).

Here are some examples showing the above features in action:

### Background information
The core idea behind iKojo is the following:
* To enable users to easily start experimenting with Kojo without having to download/install anything. When they want to dig deeper and do more serious programming, they can download/install the Kojo desktop app.
* To enable users to easily share (via a web link) the games and simulations that they write in Kojo. The game or simulation can be developed in desktop Kojo, and then shared via iKojo.  
Note - generative art that is created within desktop Kojo can easily be shared as an image via the many image sharing apps that exist out there.
