For now, here are links to some very simple animations leading up to a version of the *Lunar Lander* game:

[A shape bouncing around in the canavas](https://github.com/litan/mm/blob/master/animation/anim-0.kojo).

[Introduction of gravity in the previous animation](https://github.com/litan/mm/blob/master/animation/anim-1.kojo).

[Using multiple images to represent a sprite bouncing around in the canvas under gravity](https://github.com/litan/mm/blob/master/animation/anim-2.kojo).

[Using the mouse to launch the sprite from the previous step](https://github.com/litan/mm/blob/master/animation/anim-3.kojo).
