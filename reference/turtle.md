## Turtle Graphcis Reference

While looking at the turtle commands, it is helpful to remember that a turtle has the following attributes related to 
how it moves and draws:
* position - the location on the canvas where the turtle is sitting. This location is specified by two 
numbers - the x coordinate and the y coordinate.
* heading - the direction in which the turtle's nose is pointing. Right is 0°, Up is 90°, Left is 180°, and so on.
* pen up/down state - whether the turtle's pen is down (for drawing as it moves) or up (for just moveing without drawing).
* pen color - the color of the lines drawn by the pen.
* pen thickness - the thickness of the lines drawn by the pen.
* fill color - the color that fills areas enclosed by the lines drawn by the pen.
