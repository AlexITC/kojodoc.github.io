## Kojo Strengths

### A modern programming environment
Kojo has the following features to support the flow of programming:
* Syntax highlighting.
* Code completion.
* Fast interactivity - instant feedback for graphics and console based programming.
* Online help.
* Program data exploration via Worksheet mode or Explorer pane.
* Program tracing.
* Line-by-line program running.
* Searchable program history.
* And more...

### A powerful language
Scala, the programming language used in Kojo, has great (arguably better than any other language in the world) support for three important and widely used programming/computing paradigms:
* object-oriented programming.   
* functional programming.  
* concurrent programming.  

### Product development opportunities
Kojo has great support for generative art, which can be used to create exciting designs that can be printed on t-shirts, carry bags, back-packs, cups, caps, etc.  Here is a sample t-shirt design done in Kojo:
