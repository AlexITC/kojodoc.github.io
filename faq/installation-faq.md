## Kojo Installation FAQ

### Silent installs

You can do silent installs by running the Kojo installer with the `-q` option.

For example, on Windows, you can run the following (assuming that the file you have downloaded is `Kojo_windows-x64_2_9_23_with_jre.exe`):

```shell
Kojo_windows-x64_2_9_23_with_jre.exe -q
```
